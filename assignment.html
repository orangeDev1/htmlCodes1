            <h1>News About the Eclipse on April 8, 2024</h1>
            <p>By Ayo Aje</p>
            <hr/>
            <h2>What is an <em>Solar Eclipse</em>?</h2>
            <p>A <em>solar eclipse</em> occurs when the Moon passes between the Sun and Earth, obscuring the view of the<br/>
                Sun from a small part of Earth, totally or partially. When Moon blocks all of the Sun's light, it is<br/>
                called a total solar eclipse. That is what happened on April 8, 2024 in North America.</p>
            <h2>Where & When</h3>
            <p>The path of the eclipse continued from Mexico, entering the United States in Texas, and traveling<br/>
                through Oklahoma, Arkansas, Missouri, Illinois, Kentucky, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New York,<br/>
                Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine. Small parts of Tennessee and Michigan also experienced the<br/>
                total solar eclipse. The eclipse entered Canada in Southern Ontario, and continued through Quebec,<br/>
                New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Cape Breton. The eclipse exited continental North<br/>
                America on the Atlantic coast of Newfoundland, Canada, at 5:16 p.m. NDT.</p>
            <h2>Observations</h2>
            <p>During the eclipse, some observers saw red dots around the obscured sun. Photos have shown that they<br/>
                were actually plasma. As a result, multiple outlets including USA Today and NDTV reported that these<br/>
                fiery structures were produced by solar flares â€” explosions on the sun's surface that can launch massive<br/>
                clouds of plasma. Lots of observers also shared their photos of these "solar flares." </p>
            <h2>The Next Solar Eclipse</h2>
            <p>Missed this total solar eclipse? <q>The next total solar eclipse is set to happen on Aug. 12, 2026, over<br/> 
                Greenland, Iceland, Spain, Russia and a small part of Portugal,</q> says NASA. The next total solar eclipse<br/>
                is going to be in <b>20 more years</b>, which is a really long time! Events like this are really rare, which is why<br/>
                this eclipse is a very special eclipse.</p>
